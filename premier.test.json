1	TEST123	Testing this text box to ensure it is viewed in view job details screen as requested in ticket 37.  Also testing to make sure there is a minimum of 250 characters.  It is important to have this comment box so we can record telephone conversations pertaining to the job files.	Jessica	2014-04-21 11:01:00.782663-04
2	TEST123	I like that this is time and date stamping as well as indicating whom is writing the comment.  GREAT idea!!	Jessica	2014-04-21 11:01:42.225841-04
3	TEST123	Further more, I like that it is keeping an ongoing history of the comments on here.	Jessica	2014-04-21 11:02:19.034951-04
4	TEST123	comments are viewable across duplicate job files, so we can view the comments on all jobs carrying the same job number = FANTASTIC!!!!	Jessica	2014-04-21 11:09:14.184252-04
5	TEST123	Perfect!  Comments are working across the job numbers, and being able to view in edit mode of either cab designation.  Only issue as stated in ticket 37 is that we cannot view these comments when selecting VIEW -- we can only view in edit mode.	Jessica	2014-04-21 11:12:32.867856-04
6	TEST123	Testing to make sure that this comment will copy over to designation 1 of 2 as well as be able to view it in view screen and not just in edit.	Jessica	2014-04-28 12:49:34.818002-04
7	TEST123	Great!  This seems to be working fine now.  You can view the comments across the same job number by selecting VIEW from the job schedule :)	Jessica	2014-04-28 12:50:44.864549-04
